## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Senior Platform Engineer with 11+ years of experience, including **6 years at a fast-paced venture-backed startup** (Turbot), where I've been involved from design to development to production deployment of two large-scale applications. Expert in building reliable "paved road" platforms that enable engineering teams to move fast safely — from EKS cluster architecture and CI/CD pipelines to observability, networking, and SRE practices. 

My journey: Started as a Backend QA Engineer at Cognizant, which gave me a unique perspective on how things break. Moved into Python development, learning to build and troubleshoot systems from the inside. Pivoted to cloud engineering after excelling in a hackathon that led to my role at Turbot, where I've architected and managed production systems across AWS and GCP with Kubernetes, Python, and modern DevOps tooling.

Proven track record: reduced deployment downtime from 45 minutes to 15 seconds, improved system performance by 40%, cut infrastructure costs by 63%, and maintained 99.95% uptime SLA. Strong automation mindset — I believe in automating and creating tools for everything. Naturally curious, I use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, NotebookLM) daily to learn new patterns, validate ideas, and speed up problem-solving.
